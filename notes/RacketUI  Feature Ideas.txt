RaketUI Feature Ideas:

- Add multiple items at one time (another button)
- automatically place cursor in first blank box ( when something is added, have 
  the first box automatically selected (for after ability to add multiple 
  items at once))
- automatically close (exit) first raketui when another one attempts to open
- stop the web application when the racket file stops running - detect when the 
  racket program is stopped.
- Make it look prettier (css for colors, etc.) (I wonder if there is a way to make the
  desktop background the background of the application, for lols)

[DONE]- have "remove this entry" and "load/apply" on a blank entry give an error
